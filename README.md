Decoupling economic growth and environmental impact: The Game of GHGs, CO2 and GDP in New Zealand

New Zealand has one of the highest GHG per capita emissions globally (Stats NZ, 2022). This technical report analyses and uncovers New Zealand's GDP, GHG, and CO2 emissions trends using data analytics techniques such as descriptive and predictive analytics. It commences by identifying the gases that primarily influence GHG emissions. Further, it attempts to uncover the relationship between GDP per capita, Annual GHG, CO2 and GHG per capita using data analytics techniques. Lastly, the future trends of the above four variables are predicted for the next five years. The findings will help the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trades to design effective policies and strategies for addressing global environmental and economic challenges. 


Abbreviations: GHG per capita = Greenhouse gas emission per capita, GDP per capita = Gross Domestic Product per capita, NZ = New Zealand, CO2 = Carbon dioxide.
