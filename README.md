# Decoupling economic growth and environmental impact: The Game of GHGs, CO2 and GDP in New Zealand

  New Zealand has one of the highest GHG per capita emissions globally (Stats NZ, 2022). This technical report analyses and uncovers New Zealand's GDP, GHG, and CO2 emissions trends using data analytics techniques such as descriptive and predictive analytics. It commences by identifying the gases that primarily influence GHG emissions. Further, it attempts to uncover the relationship between GDP per capita, Annual GHG, CO2 and GHG per capita using data analytics techniques. Lastly, the future trends of the above four variables are predicted for the next five years. The findings will help the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trades to design effective policies and strategies for addressing global environmental and economic challenges. 


**Abbreviations**: GHG per capita = Greenhouse gas emission per capita, GDP per capita = Gross Domestic Product per capita, NZ = New Zealand, CO2 = Carbon dioxide. 


## The research question driving this technical report is: 


**_“What is the overall impact of GHG and CO2 emissions on GDP in New Zealand?”_**

## Data Sources

a.	**GDP per capita** (in international-$ in 2017 prices): https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank#sources-and-processing 
This dataset contains the GDP per capita of all the countries from 1990 to 2022. The data was further filtered by country ‘New Zealand’. The values present the country’s economic output per person. 

b.	**Annual CO2 emissions including land use change** (in tones):
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-including-land-use 
This data contains annual CO2 emissions from all the countries, including land use changes from 1850 to 2022. It was filtered by country ‘New Zealand’. 

c.	**Cumulative CO2 emission from source** (in tones):
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-fuel?tab=table 
This dataset contains cumulative CO2 emissions from various sources, like cement, gas, oil, etc., of all the countries from 1750 to 2022. It was filtered by country ‘New Zealand’. 

d.	**GHG Emissions** (in tones of CO₂ equivalents):
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions?tab=table 
This dataset contains annual GHG emissions by all the countries from 1850 to 2022. The data is filtered by country ‘New Zealand’. 

e.	**GHG emissions from different sectors around the world** (tones of CO₂ equivalents):
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-by-sector 
This dataset contains GHG emissions data from different sectors worldwide from 1990 to 2022. The data is filtered by country ‘New Zealand’.

f.	**GHG emissions by gases** (in tones):
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-by-gas 
The data contains various gases that contribute to overall GHG emissions worldwide from 1850 to 2022. The data is filtered by country ‘New Zealand’.

## Key findings and recommendations

  The analysis illustrates that CO2 emissions significantly contribute to GHG emissions and positively correlate with GDP per capita, although the effects are relatively small in New Zealand. Moreover, it also has a low positive correlation with GHG per capita. It also indicates that while the analysis shows CO2 contributes to GDP per capita growth, the overall emissions negatively affect the GDP growth. Cumulative CO2 emissions from key sectors like oil, gas and coal influence the country’s GDP per capita. Government and policymakers can specifically focus on introducing policies and taking measures to reduce CO2 emissions from these sectors. For instance, eliminating methane leaks and flaring can help reduce carbon from oil and gas (Kolaczkowski et al., 2024). In addition, carbon capture storage can be developed across the country, and fuels can be switched to improve energy efficiencies.

The analysis also highlights that GHG emissions from transport and industry significantly contribute to New Zealand's GDP per capita. Therefore, policy guidelines should be developed to target these sectors' emissions to balance environmental sustainability and economic growth.
